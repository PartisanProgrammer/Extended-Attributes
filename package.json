  "description": "The ButtonAttributeEditor is a part of a Unity plugin that enhances the Unity inspector by allowing methods marked with a custom ButtonAttribute to be invoked directly from the inspector. It provides a user-friendly interface with a toggle button to show or hide the list of methods, and each method is represented by a button. The editor also includes custom styling and formatting for better visual representation. The plugin is designed to improve workflow efficiency and user experience within the Unity editor.",
